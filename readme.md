Bash Scripts - Quick Tools for Developers
========================================

A few scripts I use to make dev life easier. Each one has its own readme for details.

Scripts
-------

- **KillPort**: Free up ports by killing whatever is blocking them. [See how](killport/killport.md)
- **Ping Monitor**: Log if your sites are up or down. [See how](ping_script/ping_script.md)
- **One-Click Project Opener**: Open your project and start your dev server in one go. [See how](one_click_open_project_script/one_click_open_project_script.md)

Each script lives in its own folder. Check the docs for setup and tips.
